The goal of our website is to create an online customer service for people to scroll through our website and choose what installation they wanted, what type of material to use, and the prices of those installations. Most of the website was created by John; as the developer, he took the bootstrap coding and incorporated it into the website and remodeled it as his own. He made the layouts of the pages of the website himself and most of the visual things you see are created by John. Aaron was the one who held the information about the website. Since his father is the owner of the company, he had most of the pictures we used and had knowledge about the content to write about and give information to customers.

The main focus of our website is to create a reliable customer service for looring and other types of installations for people to browse through and choose.
